## Description
This repository hosts a Python implementation of the PPO algorithm, a powerful method within the realm of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We apply PPO to solve the Swimmer problem.
 The implementation aims to showcase the effectiveness of PPO in solving continious spaces of action . we implemented both clip and kl of the PPO algorithm.

## Requirements
The code is implemented in Python 3.8.10 and has been tested on Windows 10 without encountering any issues. Below are the non-standard libraries and their corresponding versions used in writing the code:
<pre>
gymnasium==0.29.1
matplotlib==3.5.1
numpy==1.22.0
pygame==2.5.2
torch==2.0.1+cu118
</pre>

**Note:** This repository uses the latest version of Gymnasium for compatibility and optimization purposes. This code does not utilize any deprecated or old versions of the Gym library.



## Usage
instal gymnasium and run the code on test mode with wanted weights.
   

The network weights have been pre-saved in the many directories. Therefore, there's no requirement to start training from scratch for testing the code.



## Showcase
every approaches results can be shown in the said png of results.
